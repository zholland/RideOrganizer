          <p class="lead">
            When friends, sports teams, or school clubs are planning an out-of-town (or even in-town) trip, organizing
            transportation can be very difficult, especially when it comes to carpooling. RideOrganizer is hoping to
            change that.
          </p>

          <p class="lead description-paragraph">
            In an instance where carpooling is decided as the transport of choice, individuals who volunteer to drive
            should pick up passengers in the most time and distance efficient manner prior to heading to their final
            destination. The fewest number of vehicles to accommodate all travellers should also be used. However, this
            is not always the case; often two drivers end up picking up different passengers who live very near to one
            another or the number of vehicles used is not minimized.
          </p>

          <p class="lead description-paragraph">Situations where a passenger would like to ride with another passenger or
            driver (or conversely the case where two individuals do not want to be in the same vehicle) must also be
            considered. Additionally, drivers may have preferences that must be taken into account such as a maximum
            distance they are willing to drive to pick up a passenger. RideOrganizer aims to solve all of these
            problems.
